The most wonderful think about web development is its community. This field is *constantly* evolving, and its success heavily dependent on working together.


### 1. Course Issues Board:
Your first stop for aid is the [GitHub Issues Board](https://github.com/Media-Ed-Online/intro-web-dev/issues) for this course. Instructors and students both patrol the threads here, and it's your best place to get results quickly.

Plus, participation is required, and you can hit two birds with one stone by asking here first.
